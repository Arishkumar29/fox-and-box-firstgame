# my first game using unity
1. Project Setup
Unity Installation:
Install the required Unity version (e.g., Unity 2021.3 LTS) and any needed modules (Android, iOS, WebGL, etc.).

Repository Initialization:

Fork or clone the repository.
Set up Git LFS if your project includes large binary assets like models, textures, or audio.
Project Configuration:

Open the project in Unity Editor.
Configure project settings, including quality, physics, and input mapping.
Import any essential packages (e.g., Cinemachine, Post Processing).
2. Branching Strategy & Version Control
Main Branches:

main/master: Contains stable, production-ready code.
develop: Integrates all tested features before merging into main.
Feature Branches:

Create a new branch for every new feature or fix (e.g., feature/vehicle-customization or bugfix/collision-handling).
Use clear, descriptive names and commit messages to track changes effectively.
Best Practices:

Commit frequently with meaningful messages.
Use pull requests (PRs) to merge feature branches into develop so changes can be reviewed.
3. Development Process
Coding Standards:

Follow the project’s coding guidelines (naming conventions, file organization, etc.).
Write modular, reusable code and document your functions and classes.
Asset Management:

Use Unity’s asset folders to organize scenes, scripts, prefabs, and other resources.
Regularly update the asset database and resolve any conflicts if working in teams.
Testing in Editor:

Use Unity’s Play mode to test new features.
Write unit tests for game logic (using NUnit or Unity’s Test Framework).
4. Continuous Integration (CI)
Automate your builds and tests with GitHub Actions. A sample CI workflow might look like this:

yaml
Copy
Edit
name: Unity Build & Test

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - develop
  pull_request:
    branches:
      - develop

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v2

      - name: Cache Unity packages
        uses: actions/cache@v2
        with:
          path: ~/.cache/unity3d
          key: ${{ runner.os }}-unity

      - name: Setup Unity environment
        uses: game-ci/unity-builder@v2
        with:
          unityVersion: 2021.3.0f1

      - name: Build project for Linux
        run: |
          /opt/unity/Editor/Unity \
            -batchmode \
            -projectPath . \
            -buildTarget StandaloneLinux64 \
            -executeMethod BuildScript.PerformBuild \
            -quit

      - name: Run tests
        run: |
          /opt/unity/Editor/Unity \
            -batchmode \
            -projectPath . \
            -runTests \
            -testPlatform PlayMode \
            -testResults ./test-results.xml \
            -quit
This YAML file sets up an automated build and testing pipeline. Adjust the Unity version, build target, and test settings according to your project’s needs.

5. Testing & Quality Assurance
Automated Testing:

Integrate unit tests and integration tests using Unity’s Test Framework.
Use CI to run tests on every push or PR to catch regressions early.
Manual QA:

Regularly run the game in the Editor and on target platforms.
Test gameplay elements such as car physics, track interactions, and multiplayer functionality.
Performance Profiling:

Utilize Unity Profiler to monitor CPU/GPU usage, memory allocation, and frame rates.
6. Code Review & Merging
Pull Request Process:

Submit a PR for every feature branch.
Include a summary of changes, screenshots, or video demos where applicable.
Ensure all CI checks pass before merging.
Review Criteria:

Code quality and consistency.
Adherence to the project’s design guidelines.
Functionality and performance impact.
Merging:

After thorough review and testing, merge feature branches into develop.
Periodically merge develop into main for stable release builds.
7. Deployment & Release
Build Pipeline:

Use Unity’s build settings to generate executable builds for your target platforms.
Automate the build process with CI (e.g., using GitHub Actions, Unity Cloud Build).
Distribution:

Publish stable builds as releases on GitHub.
Optionally, distribute to beta testers using platforms like TestFlight or Google Play Console.
Changelog & Documentation:

Maintain a detailed changelog for every release.
Update project documentation to reflect new features and bug fixes.
8. Iteration & Maintenance
Continuous Feedback:

Gather feedback from testers, community, and team members.
Prioritize fixes and new features based on user input.
Regular Updates:

Keep dependencies and Unity versions up-to-date.
Refactor code periodically to improve maintainability and performance.
Issue Tracking:

Use GitHub Issues to track bugs, feature requests, and tasks.
Regularly review and triage issues to keep the project moving forward.
