# my first game using unity
#1. Project Setup
   
Unity Installation:
Install the required Unity version (e.g., Unity 2021.3 LTS) and any needed modules (Android, iOS, WebGL, etc.).

#Repository Initialization:

Fork or clone the repository.
Set up Git LFS if your project includes large binary assets like models, textures, or audio.
Project Configuration:

Open the project in Unity Editor.
Configure project settings, including quality, physics, and input mapping.
Import any essential packages (e.g., Cinemachine, Post Processing).
#2. Branching Strategy & Version Control
Main Branches:

main/master: Contains stable, production-ready code.
develop: Integrates all tested features before merging into main.
Feature Branches:

Create a new branch for every new feature or fix (e.g., feature/vehicle-customization or bugfix/collision-handling).
Use clear, descriptive names and commit messages to track changes effectively.
Best Practices:

Commit frequently with meaningful messages.
Use pull requests (PRs) to merge feature branches into develop so changes can be reviewed.
#3. Development Process
Coding Standards:

Follow the project’s coding guidelines (naming conventions, file organization, etc.).
Write modular, reusable code and document your functions and classes.
Asset Management:

Use Unity’s asset folders to organize scenes, scripts, prefabs, and other resources.
Regularly update the asset database and resolve any conflicts if working in teams.
Testing in Editor:

Use Unity’s Play mode to test new features.
Write unit tests for game logic (using NUnit or Unity’s Test Framework).

#4. Testing & Quality Assurance
Automated Testing:

Integrate unit tests and integration tests using Unity’s Test Framework.
Use CI to run tests on every push or PR to catch regressions early.
Manual QA:

Regularly run the game in the Editor and on target platforms.
Test gameplay elements such as car physics, track interactions, and multiplayer functionality.
Performance Profiling:

Utilize Unity Profiler to monitor CPU/GPU usage, memory allocation, and frame rates.
#5. Code Review & Merging
Pull Request Process:

Submit a PR for every feature branch.
Include a summary of changes, screenshots, or video demos where applicable.
Ensure all CI checks pass before merging.
Review Criteria:

Code quality and consistency.
Adherence to the project’s design guidelines.
Functionality and performance impact.
Merging:

After thorough review and testing, merge feature branches into develop.
Periodically merge develop into main for stable release builds.
#6. Deployment & Release
Build Pipeline:

Use Unity’s build settings to generate executable builds for your target platforms.
Automate the build process with CI (e.g., using GitHub Actions, Unity Cloud Build).
Distribution:

Publish stable builds as releases on GitHub.
Optionally, distribute to beta testers using platforms like TestFlight or Google Play Console.
Changelog & Documentation:

Maintain a detailed changelog for every release.
Update project documentation to reflect new features and bug fixes.
#7. Iteration & Maintenance
Continuous Feedback:

Gather feedback from testers, community, and team members.
Prioritize fixes and new features based on user input.
Regular Updates:

Keep dependencies and Unity versions up-to-date.
Refactor code periodically to improve maintainability and performance.
Issue Tracking:

Use GitHub Issues to track bugs, feature requests, and tasks.
Regularly review and triage issues to keep the project moving forward.
